BookBrainz - unique identifiers for books and texts

Assuming you are running Ubuntu with PostgreSQL installed (basically
assuming you can run the MusicBrainz server):

    ./setup.sh

Then:

    ./upgrade.sh

To run the latest code/schema.

We have some test data, which can be applied with:

    psql -U bookbrainz bookbrainz < sql/test-data.sql
